                Description:
                    Relationship selectors match elements based on their relation with other
                    elements.To understand these selectors, it is important to recognize how
                    elements in a web document are related to each other.

                    -> Inheritance:
                        Inheritance is another important concept in CSS. It makes certain styles
                        apply not only to the specified element but also to all its descendant
                        elements.
                        Any property can explicitly be given the value inherit to use the same
                        value as the one the parent element has for that property.

                    -> Adjacent: (+)
                        The adjacent sibling selector selects the second element if it comes directly
                        after the first element.

                    -> Descendent:
                        The descendent selector matches an element if it is the child or grandchild
                        of another element. It is useful when you want to apply a style to an
                        element only when it resides within another element.

                    -> Direct Child Selector: (>)
                        The direct child selector matches its second element if it is the immediate
                        descendant of its first element.

                    -> General Sibling Selector: (~)
            **/

            p {
                color: inherit;

            p + a {}

            p a {}

            p > a {}

            p ~ a {}
